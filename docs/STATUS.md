# Status (update as things change)

Last updated: 4 Nov 2026

## Plan
- Target go-live: 30 Nov 2026 (production), with shadow mode from 26 Nov.
- Live schedule with forecast dates: `docs/delivery_plan.xlsx` (dates recalculate from actuals).
- Current phase: Build 1, data collectors (planned 2-6 Nov). Forecast slips while design sign-off
  (A12) and access (A06-A11) are open.

## Decisions pending
- A12: application team to confirm architecture option A (direct polling) in writing.

## Access and inputs still open (blocks running against production, not the build)
| Item | Action / query |
|---|---|
| Monitoring server (VM) | A06 |
| Read-only gMSA with WinRM rights + firewall rules | A07, A08 |
| WebLogic read-only monitor user | A09 |
| SQL Server read-only login (VIEW SERVER STATE, msdb read) | A10 |
| Test user for the login probe | A11, Q20 |
| Production load balancer URL | Q17 |
| Component owner list | A04, Q32 |
| SMTP relay access | A13 |
| Month-end close dates | Q46 |
Requests for the monitoring server and WinRM access have been drafted for the infrastructure team.

## Issues raised with other teams
- Q52: production SQL Server C: drive 8.6% free (below the 10% Degraded threshold); data drive 11.6%;
  SQL Server Agent set to Manual start.
- Q50: HFM web services route only to web node 2.
- Q51: HFM nodes 2 and 3 run in a different time zone.

## Build approach until access arrives
- Build and test every collector against fakes and the masked sample data.
- Where permitted, test Windows checks against the development servers.
